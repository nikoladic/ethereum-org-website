## How can I get involved? {#how-can-i-get-involved}

The Ethereum community includes people of many different backgrounds and skillsets. Whether you’re a developer, an artist, or an accountant, there are ways to get involved. Here’s a list of suggestions that might help you get started.

**Developers**

- Try out Ethereum by visiting [ethereum.org/build/](/build/)
- [Find a bounty on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), work on a small or large technical issue, earn crypto!
- Attend an [ETHGlobal](http://ethglobal.co/) hackathon near you!
- Check out [projects related to your area of expertise or programming language of choice](/developers/#language-specific-resources)
- Watch or participate in the [Core Dev calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaM7G4Llrb7zfMXCZVEXEABT8OSnd4-7w)

**Researchers & Academics**

Do you have a background in mathematics, cryptography, or economics? You might be interested in some of the cutting-edge work being done within the Ethereum ecosystem

- [Challenges.ethereum.org](https://challenges.ethereum.org/) - a series of high-value research bounties, where you can earn >\$100,000 USD
- [Ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch) - Ethereum’s primary forum for research, and the world’s most influential forum for cryptoeconomics

**Have non-technical skills, and aren’t sure where to start?**

If you’re not a developer, it can be hard to know where to start in Ethereum. Here are a few suggestions, along with resources for specific professional backgrounds.

- **Organize a meetup in your city**
  - Not sure how to start? The [BUIDL network](https://consensys.net/developers/buidlnetwork/) can help.
- **Write content about Ethereum**
  - Ethereum needs good writers who can explain its value in plain language
  - Not ready to publish your own articles? Consider contributing to the existing content on community resources like [EthHub](https://docs.ethhub.io/), or propose new content for ethereum.org!
- **Offer to take notes for community calls**
  - There are many open-source community calls, and having notetakers is a huge help. If you’re interested, join the Ethereum Cat Herders chat [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum-cat-herders/meeting-notes-and-summaries), and introduce yourself!
- **Translate Ethereum content into your native language**
  - Ethereum.org maintains a translation program that translates the website, and other resources, into many different languages
  - Find out how to get involved [here](https://ethereum.org/languages/#ethereum-org-translation-program)

**Financial professional or accountant**

- Ethereum is home to the “Decentralized Finance” ecosystem - a network of protocols and applications that offer an alternative financial system. If you’re a financial professional, check out some DeFi apps at [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/) or [DeFiPrime](https://defiprime.com)
- Accountant? Assets on Ethereum - ETH, tokens, DeFi, etc - introduce many novel accounting issues. You could start by checking out some projects that aim to help users of cryptocurrency solve their bookkeeping & accounting challenges, like [VeriLedger](https://veriledger.io/) or [Rotki](https://rotki.com/)

**Product Managers**

- The Ethereum ecosystem needs your talents! Many companies are hiring for product manager roles. If you want to start by contributing to an open source project, get in touch with the [Ethereum Cat Herder](https://gitter.im/ethereum-cat-herders/community?source=orgpage)s or [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/)

**Marketing**

- There are many marketing and communications positions in the Ethereum ecosystem!
- A great way to get started is to join [MarketingDAO](https://marketingdao.org/) - an organization dedicated to marketing Ethereum and applications built on Ethereum.
