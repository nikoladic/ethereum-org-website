# Language Support {#language-support}

Ethereum is a global project, and it is critical that Ethereum.org is accessible to everyone, regardless of their nationality or language. Our community has been working hard to make this vision a reality.

Interested in contributing? [Learn more about out Translation Program](/languages/#ethereum-org-translation-program)

## Ethereum.org is available in the following languages {#available-translations}

<TranslationsAvailable/>

## Ethereum.org Translation Program {#ethereum-org-translation-program}

Interested in translating? Get involved! We're seeking volunteers to join 150+ community members who are working to translate the website into 30+ languages. Here's how:

1. Follow [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/invite) to join our project on CrowdIn.

   - You will need to create a CrowdIn account if you don't already have one. Here's [documentation on how to use CrowdIn](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/).

2. Find the language you want to participate in and select a document to translate. If translation progress is below 100%, please contribute! Don't see your language listed? [Open an issue here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose).

   - A note on content versions: we use version management within CrowdIn to avoid translation delays for added content. When you check out a language (e.g. [Filipino](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/fil#)), you'll see folders for each site version (i.e. "Contents v1.0", "Contents v1.1", etc.). We encourage you to translate the highest version of the content in order to provide the most up-to-date content to users. If you've already started working on a lower version, that's fine too! We'll add any completed version to the website.

3. Once you've completed the translation (i.e. all files for a content version display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete (i.e. review progress is 100%), we will add it to the website.

Do you have any questions? Please join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ethtranslation/shared_invite/enQtOTc2MTA3OTE4NjMwLTc0OWFhYmY2ZjY4MWYzODdiMTBjOGMyNWU0MDJkNWRkNDFlNzg0NjZlNTUwMWQxM2E5MTFjMWJhMDU2Y2M3OWI) workspace and comment in the **#\_support** channel. Feel free to collaborate with other contributors by joining language channels.

Thank you for your participation in the [ethereum.org](/) Translation Program! ðŸ¦„

## Ethereum Community Translation Program {#ethereum-community-translation-program}

We're also undertaking an initiative to translate Ethereum content beyond ethereum.org! Are you interested in translating valuable Ethereum content from authors across the community? Please follow [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/contents-translation/invite) to join this separate project on CrowdIn. From there, follow the same steps outlined above.

If there's Ethereum-related content you'd like to see translated, please [let us know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg)!
