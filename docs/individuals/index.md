## Smart Contracts

A "smart contract" is simply a piece of code that is running on Ethereum. It’s called a "contract" because code that runs on Ethereum can control valuable things like ETH or other digital assets.

## Use an application built on ethereum

One of the best ways to get started with Ethereum is to jump right in! There are many Ethereum-based applications that you can use today.

Here are just a few apps built on Ethereum - we rotate this list frequently!

Some of these applications might require a wallet - [see the section below for more information.](./#3-what-is-a-wallet-and-which-one-should-i-use)

## 2. What is ETH, and how do I get it? {#2-what-is-eth-and-how-do-i-get-it}

ETH is Ethereum's native currency. It is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in many Ethereum-based applications like the ones above.

The easiest way to get ETH is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy ETH, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.

## 3. What is a wallet, and which one should I use? {#3-what-is-a-wallet-and-which-one-should-i-use}

Wallets are applications that make it easy to hold and send ETH, as well as interact with applications built on Ethereum.
