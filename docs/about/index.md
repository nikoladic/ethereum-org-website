# About Ethereum.org

Ethereum.org is a primary online resource for the Ethereum community. The purpose of the site is to **"Be the best portal to Ethereum for our growing global community"** - read more about what this means [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/purpose.md).

Ethereum.org is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution. If youâ€™re interested in helping to improve ethereum.org, [this contribution guide will help you get started](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website).

Updates to the website are made by a [team of people from across the Ethereum ecosystem](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website#contributors) guided by our [design principles](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/design-principles.md). This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: raising questions in [issues](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues), [submitting pull requests](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pulls), or [contacting the team](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg) is always helpful!
