# About Ethereum.org

Ethereum.org is a primary online resource for the Ethereum community. The purpose of the site is to _“Be the best portal to Ethereum for our growing global community"_ - read more about what this means [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/purpose.md).

Ethereum.org is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution. If you’re interested in helping to improve ethereum.org, [this contribution guide will help you get started](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website).

Updates to the website are made by a team of people from across the Ethereum ecosystem. This team includes project managers, developers, designers, marketing and communications, and subject matter experts. Community input informs every decision: raising questions in [issues](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues), [submitting PRs](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/pulls), or [contacting the team](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg) is helpful!

## Ethereum.org Roadmap

Ever since the launch of ethereum.org, we strive to be transparent about how we operate. This is one of our core values, as we believe transparency is crucial to Ethereum's success.

We use GitHub as our primary project management tool. We divide our tasks in 4 categories; in progress, planned, implemented, and backlog. We do our best to keep the community informed what the status is of a specific task.
