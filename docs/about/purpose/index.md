# What is the purpose of Ethereum.org?

In one sentence, the purpose of Ethereum.org is:

**"Be the best portal to Ethereum for our growing global community"**

Let’s unpack this:

- **“Best…”**

  - Ethereum.org has to **meet and exceed** a basic standard of quality
  - It needs to be discoverable (SEO), it needs to be easy to use and navigate (UX), and it needs to leave a strong impression (design & branding)
  - "What is the best website for a blockchain platform?" remains an open question - we are pioneers. Building this requires **experimentation**.

- **“Portal…”**

  - We are not trying to build "Encyclopedia Ethereum", but rather be the best possible “entry-point” to Ethereum.
  - **This doesn’t mean** **no native content**, but it does mean that the purpose of that native content is still to be an “on-boarding portal” and not a substitute for the extensive resources that already exist.
  - One important function of the site is to support and integrate with community built resources, giving them more visibility and making them more discoverable

- **“…to Ethereum”**

  - Ethereum is a big thing: it includes a community, a technology, a set of ideas and ideologies, and more.
  - This means the website needs to handle many different user journeys, from “a developer who wants a specific tool” and “a newcomer who just bought some ETH and doesn’t know what a wallet is"
  - Being a “portal to Ethereum” means being a portal many different things.

- **"...for our growing global community"**
  - Ethereum's community is at the heart of this: we need to not just _serve_ the community, but incorporate their feedback and work with a large group of stakeholders to improve it.
  - The website isn't just for the community we have _now_ but must anticipate how it will grow in the future
  - Ethereum's community is global, containing people from many languages, regions, and cultures.
