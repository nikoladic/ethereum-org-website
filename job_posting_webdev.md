## Job Posting: Full Time Web Developer at the Ethereum Foundation

The Ethereum Foundation is looking to hire a full-time web developer. In this role, you will support ethereum.org as well as other web properties managed or created by the Ethereum Foundation.

### About you

- **You're excited about ethereum and other decentralized tech.** You don't need to be a cryptocurrency expert, but the websites you create and manage will be critical resources for the Ethereum community. Familiarity with Ethereum, its ethos and vision, is essential.

- **You're a great communicator used to working with distributed teams.** Succeeding in this role will mean working with a remote-first team where clear communication is essential.

- **You're a web developer with a good design sensibility.** Part of your job will be working with designers who contribute to the website. You'll also make a few tweaks yourself - an eye for clean, functional design will be valuable.

- **You have an ownership mentality.** When you take on a task, you get it done. You proactively troubleshoot problems blocking your path, instead of waiting for instructions.

### Your responsibilities:

- Development & design ownership of ethereum.org
    - You'll work closely with a project manager, designers, and devops team to ship regular updates to ethereum.org and develop larger releases
    - You'll review and comment on github issues and PRs submitted by the community

- 4+ years in a web development role
- Deep familiarity with core web technologies
- Comfortable with modern web development standards
- Familiarity with VuePress a bonus
- Experience building websites for international audiences & supporting a large number of language localizations a bonus
